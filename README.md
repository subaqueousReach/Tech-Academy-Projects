# Tech-Academy-Projects
This repository is for my Tech Academy projects

### Introduction
This would be where I summarize what the project is about. It should be short and concise. Two or three sentences should do for smaller projects.

### Technologies
This would be where I list the different languages and libraries used in the project. This is useful for re-launching the project as it can clarify issues a user may come across when updating it. It also works to showcase what languages the original developer used in the project for potential employers.
